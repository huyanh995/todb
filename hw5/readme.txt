MAIN PART
Q1:
I am not sure whether books should be categorized as papers,
especially in academic contexts where researchers often expand
their journal work into book chapters. For simplicity, I have
included all articles, conference papers, and books under the
broad term 'papers'.

The results are in q1_output.xml file.

Q2:
Again I am not sure if I understood professor note well.
So I only output 1 paper, but there are 4 papers
satisfied the requirements.

The results are in q2_output.xml file.
